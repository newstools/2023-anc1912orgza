The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the African National Congress (ANC) held a Special National Executive Committee to consider a range of organisational, national and international matters.

President Cyril Ramaphosa briefed the NEC on various engagements between the governments of Tanzania, Angola and Uganda.  These are fraternal states led by fraternal parties and sister liberation movements with long-standing relations with the ANC, who will be undertaking visits to South Africa in the coming weeks and will engage with the ANC.  The NEC was also briefed about South Africa’s Chairship of BRICS in 2023.  The NEC affirmed the strategic role of BRICS and the need to elevate its role as a critical international body in international relations.

The NEC re-affirmed the ANC’s long-standing policy of solidarity with the Saharawi Republic against the illegal Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara.  The NEC further affirmed its solidarity with the people of Palestine against Israeli occupation and continues to call for the return to the negotiation table to give effect to a 2-state solution that will see a sovereign State of Palestine peacefully co-existing alongside the State of Israel.  In this regard, the NEC called on the African Union to reject any attempts to grant apartheid Israel observer status in the AU.

The NEC expressed support to President Ramaphosa’s intervention to appoint a dedicated Minister of Electricity who will lead the charge in driving the necessary interventions aimed at eliminating loadshedding and stabilising electricity supply in the country.  This intervention is in line with the resolutions of the ANC’s 55th National Conference, which calls on government to take immediate and decisive interventions to end loadshedding, alongside the implementation of long-term solutions to the country’s energy supply crisis.

The NEC considered reports on the contested Regional Conference of the Mangaung Region in the Free State and the challenges relating to the processes leading up to the Western Cape Provincial Conference.  In relation to the Free State conference, the NEC noted the work undertaken by the Task Team led by Cde David Mahlobo and its recommendations to the NWC.  To this end, the NEC  supports the decision of the IPC that recognized the outcome of Mangaung conference held at Mvelo Safari Lodge and Lejweleputswa and the respective RECs as duly elected.  The NEC further directed the PEC to take appropriate action against the organizers of a parallel conference held at President’s Hotel.  The NEC further directed the PEC to develop and implement political management programme or mechanism of bringing all comrades in the affected region into the ANC fold.

In relation to the Western Cape Provincial Conference, the NEC made the following decisions:

Granted permission for the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) to start the process of BGMs and other due processes towards convening the provincial conference.
Endorsed the report that includes the 66 wards (potential branches) and the 20 branches granted the special branch status by the IPC.
To deploy a team of NEC members to the province to assist the IPC with the process of preparation of the provincial conference.
The provincial conference to be convened no later than 8 April 2023.
The regional Conference of Dullah Omar and Southern Cape Regions must be convened under the leadership of the new PEC.

The NEC ratified the ANC 55th National Conference resolutions, which will be released publicly in due course.

In considering deployments, the NEC approved deployment of full-time NEC Members to support organisational work at Luthuli House.  The following members have been deployed full-time to Head Office:


Cde Sibongile Besani as Head: Presidency
Cde Febe Potgieter as Head: Research. She will continue with her role as General Manager until 31 March 2023, by which time a new incumbent would have been appointed.

Cde David Makhura as Head: Political Education
Cde Mduduzi Manana as Head: Organising & Membership
