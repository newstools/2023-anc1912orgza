This year’s Budget Vote Speech is expected to outline a resource plan that is supportive of the 2023 State of the Nation Address delivered by President Cyril Ramaphosa. In this regard, the African National Congress is expecting a pro-poor Budget Vote that seeks to re-energise the economy by placing it on a path of sustainable and inclusive growth whilst being responsive to current electricity availability challenges as well as persistent poverty and inequality lines. END Issued by the African National Congress Enquiries Mahlengi Bhengu –MotsiriNational Spokesperson0768915420 Media RelationsAmos Phago (0767506961)
