The National Working Committee of the ANC convened for the first time on the 13th February 2023 following its election at the ANC NEC meeting held on the 27th and 28th January 2023. The NWC reflected on the outcomes of the recent NEC Lekgotla whose deliberations were informed by the outcomes of the 55th ANC National Conference as well as 2023 January 8th Statement. Guided by the 2023 theme declared by the ANC as “The Year of Decisive Action to Advance the People’s Interest and Renew Our Movement”, the NWC received reports from national officials and reflected on various matters that include the State of the Nation Adress delivered by the President. Here the NWC acknowledged and supported the core message and wide ranging actions outlined in the State of the Nation Adress, aimed at tackling socio-economic challenges faced by the people of South Africa. In this regard, the NWC resolved to support efforts by government particularly urgent actions that will be undertaken to address the ongoing energy crisis so as to end loadshedding. Regarding the reconfiguration of government, the NWC advised that the President should be provided the space to outline clear plans so as to ensure that the government is more responsive, prompt and can deliver on commitments. The NWC anticipates that these plans will be outlined from February, going forward. On organisational matters, the NWC also considered proposals on the constitution of NEC subcommittees and deployments to provinces. Once finalised ,these will be shared with all our structures, allies and the people of South Africa. END/ Issued by the African National Congress Enquiries Mahlengi Bhengu -Motsiri National Spokesperson0768915420 Media Relations Amos Phago (0767506961)
