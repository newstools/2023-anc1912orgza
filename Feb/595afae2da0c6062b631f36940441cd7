The ANC is currently consulting with its legal team concerning statements made by formerEskom CEO, Mr Andre De Ruyter, in which he alleges wrongdoing and criminality againstthe organisation.The ANC is firmly committed, through promoting and supporting policy, legislation, andaction, to deal with any acts of corruption – or other forms criminality – and to hold anyperpetrators to account. Corruption and criminality are implacable enemies ofdevelopment and our commitment to build a better life for all.Accordlingy, we reiterate our call to Mr De Ruyter to lay criminal charges, with verifiabledetails about his serious allegations, to allow law enforecement agencies to investigate,and where appropriate, to prosecute those who have a case to answer, including any ANCmembers or public representatives who have violated both the laws of the Republic as wellas the prescripts of the ANC Constitution and their oath of membership.In this regard, we draw attention to the provisions of Section 34 of the Prevention andCombating of Corrupt Activities Act, 2004 (Act 12 of 2004) which makes it illegal for anyperson in a position of authority not to report an act or information of corruption orcriminality.To date, the ANC is not aware of any action taken by Mr De Ruyter in this respect. The ANCurges Mr De Ruyter to fulfil his constitutional and legal obligations to officially report tothe police any act of criminality and/or illegality he is aware of within the next seven days.The ANC once again advises Mr De Ruyter that by law it is obligatory for “any person whoholds a position of authority and who knows or ought reasonably to have known orsuspected that any other person has committed an offence (of corruption), theft, fraud,extortion, forgery or uttering of a forged document involving an amount of R100 000,00 ormore, must report such knowledge or suspicion or cause such knowledge or suspicion tobe reported to any police official”.Failure by Mr De Ruyter to bring such information forward and report it in line with hisobligations will result in the ANC laying Section 34 charges against him. ENDISSUED BY THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESSEnquiriesMahlengi Bhengu-MotsiriNational Spokesperson076 891 5420 Media RelationsAmos Phago076 750 6961
