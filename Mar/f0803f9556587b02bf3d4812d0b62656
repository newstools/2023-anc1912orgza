The African National Congress (ANC) mourns the passing of Comrade Stephanie Kemp, a veteran and fearless pioneer during the liberation struggle whose sacrifice and commitment to the people of South Africa knew no boundaries.As an Afrikaner, during years of apartheid South Africa Comrade Stephanie jettisoned privilege and comfort for the humanity and freedoms of all people.  It was her quest for justice, equality, a non-racial, and non-sexist South Africa that will keep her name inscribed in the collective memory of South Africa’s valiant leaders who trampled darkness and despair with goodness and light.Comrade Stephanie grew up under old traditions of the Dutch Reformed Church and Afrikaans traditions, a setting which exposed her to the brutality of the apartheid system. During her days as a student at the University of Cape Town her natural sense for righteousness shaped her working class consciousness. Owing to these struggles she was imprisoned where she later went into exile. Comrade Stephanie joined the Defence and Aid Fund, the South African Communist Party (SACP), the African National Congress (ANC) and the African Resistance Movement (ARM). One constant between all these organisations is an impeccable record to fight for a better and just world.Comrade Stephanie Kemp returned to South Africa upon the unbanning of the ANC in 1990 where she remained committed to unconditional service in favour of the poor and the vulnerable. An outlook which informed standards to which she had consistently kept the ANC and the SACP accountable to up to this day. The freedoms South Africans enjoy today are as a result of Comrade Stephanie’s unflinching fight against apartheid monstrosity. She stood obdurate in the harsh face of apartheid brutality in quest for an egalitarian society devoid of oppression of one by another. The ANC and the people of South Africa are indebted to Comrade Stephanie’s unwavering commitment to the liberation struggle and her vision for a democratic South Africa.The ANC dips its flag in the loving memory of Comrade Stephanie Kemp and extends its condolences and sympathies to her family, loved ones, friends and comrades.ENDISSUED BY THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESSEnquiriesMahlengi Bhengu-MotsiriANC National Spokesperson076 891 5420 Amos PhagoMedia Relations076 750 6961
