The ANC has noted reports of a case opened by someone who is said to be a member of the ANC in the North West Province.
We wish to place it on record that leaders of the ANC act and discharge their responsibilities on behalf of the organisation, and not in their personal capacity. Consequently, any member of the ANC who has a grievance emanating from organisational processes should utilise the ANC’s dispute resolution mechanisms that are in place.
According to our records, all decisions pertaining to the erstwhile Interim Provincial Committee, and the subsequent election of the Provincial Executive Committee were handled in accordance with ANC guidelines.
The ANC will respond as and when required to do so by relevant authorities.
